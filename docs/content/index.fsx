canopy.mobile- f#rictionless mobile testing
===========================================

<div class="row">
  <div class="span1"></div>
  <div class="span6">
    <div class="well well-small" id="nuget">
      The Canopy.Mobile library can be <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Canopy.Mobile">installed from NuGet</a>:
      <pre>PM> Install-Package Canopy.Mobile</pre>
    </div>

</div>

canopy.mobile is a mobile testing framework with one goal in mind, make UI testing simple:

* Solid stabilization layer built on top of [Appium](http://appium.io/). Death to "brittle, quirky, UI tests".

* Quick to learn. Even if you've never done UI Automation, and don't know F#.

* Clean, concise API. Whenever possible we stick to [canopy](https://github.com/lefthandedgoat/canopy)'s way of doing things.

* Tries to unify Android and iOS testing whenever possible.

* MIT License.
